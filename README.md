# RecommendationSystem
This project is aimed to design a recommendation system with an adaptive collaborative filtering approach that takes into account the time factor in predicting user behavior. The main characteristics of this algorithm are time sensitivity (to increase the accuracy of predictions when time is considered an effective factor in the system) and adaptability (adapts the algorithm to the management priorities of the target company). This development is based on the paper "An adaptive approach to dealing with unstable behaviour of users in collaborative filtering systems", classified Q2 on Scimago.
